Greetings, my name is Tyler Dunneback.

I am passionate about decentralization, data sovereignty, self-hosting, and
privacy. As a result, I run a lot of my own infrastructure. You can find the
configuration for my entire home network
[here](https://git.tdback.net/nix-config).

I enjoy systems administration, infrastructure, and programming. I currently
work as a systems administrator and IT specialist.

You can find my current and past projects on my [personal git
server](https://gffit.tdback.net) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/tdback).
The source code for this website is also publicly
[available](https://git.tdback.net/website).

I am a firm believer in automating away the boring things in life, keeping
things simple, and embracing the
[three virtues of a great programmer](https://thethreevirtues.com/).

When away from the keyboard, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife and
our two labs Captain and Rainey.
