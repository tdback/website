Greetings, my name is Tyler Dunneback!

I am passionate about decentralization, data sovereignty, and privacy. As a
result, I run a lot of my own infrastructure. You can find the configuration
for my entire home network [here](https://git.tdback.net/nix-config).

I am a firm believer in automating away the boring things in life, keeping
things simple, and embracing the
[three virtues of a great programmer](https://thethreevirtues.com/).

I enjoy learning new programming languages and working on open source projects.
I am currently interested in learning more about low-level programming - such
as operating system development - and developing
[TUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface).

You can find my current and past projects on my [personal git
server](https://git.tdback.net) or [GitHub](https://github.com/tdback).
In fact, the source code for this website is publicly available in its
[git repository](https://git.tdback.net/website).

When away from the keyboard, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife and
our two labs Captain and Rainey.
